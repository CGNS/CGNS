      program write_flowvert_unst
      use cgns
      implicit none
!
!   Opens an existing CGNS file that contains a simple 3-D
!   unstructured grid, and adds a flow solution (at VERTICES)
!   to it.
!
!   The CGNS grid file 'grid.cgns' must already exist
!   (created using write_grid_unst.f)
!   Note that, other than the dimensions of the variables
!   r and p, this program is essentially identical to that for
!   writing flow solutions to a structured zone:
!   write_flowvert_str.f
!
!   Example compilation for this program is (change paths if needed!):
!   Note: when using the cgns module file, you must use the SAME fortran compiler
!   used to compile CGNS (see make.defs file)
!   ...or change, for example, via environment "setenv FC ifort"
!
!   ifort -I ../.. -c write_flowvert_unst.F90
!   ifort -o write_flowvert_unst write_flowvert_unst.o -L ../../lib -lcgns
!
!   (../../lib is the location where the compiled
!   library libcgns.a is located)
!
!   The following is no longer supported; now superseded by "use cgns":
!     include 'cgnslib_f.h'
!   Note Windows machines need to include cgnswin_f.h
