      program write_flowvert_str
      use cgns
      implicit none
!
!   Opens an existing CGNS file that contains a simple 3-D
!   structured grid, and adds a flow solution (at VERTICES)
!   to it.  (Compare this program with write_flowcent_str)
!
!   The CGNS grid file 'grid.cgns' must already exist
!   (created using write_grid_str.f)
!
!   Example compilation for this program is (change paths if needed!):
!   Note: when using the cgns module file, you must use the SAME fortran compiler
!   used to compile CGNS (see make.defs file)
!   ...or change, for example, via environment "setenv FC ifort"
!
!   ifort -I ../.. -c write_flowvert_str.F90
!   ifort -o write_flowvert_str write_flowvert_str.o -L ../../lib -lcgns
!
!   (../../lib is the location where the compiled
!   library libcgns.a is located)
!
!   The following is no longer supported; now superseded by "use cgns":
!     include 'cgnslib_f.h'
!   Note Windows machines need to include cgnswin_f.h
!
!   dimension statements (note that tri-dimensional arrays
!   r and p must be dimensioned exactly as (21,17,N) (N>=9)
!   for this particular case or else they will be written to
!   the CGNS file incorrectly!  Other options are to use 1-D
!   arrays, use dynamic memory, or pass index values to a
!   subroutine and dimension exactly there):
