/*    Program write_flowcent_str   */
/*
Opens an existing CGNS file that contains a simple 3-D
structured grid, and adds a flow solution (at CELL CENTERS)
to it.  (Compare this program with write_flowvert_str)

The CGNS grid file 'grid_c.cgns' must already exist
(created using write_grid_str.c)

Example compilation for this program is (change paths if needed!):

cc -I ../.. -c write_flowcent_str.c
cc -o write_flowcent_str_c write_flowcent_str.o -L ../../lib -lcgns

(../../lib is the location where the compiled
library libcgns.a is located)
