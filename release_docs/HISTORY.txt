New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    * The default was changed from 32-bit to 64-bit building of CGNS, PR#216
    * The minimum CMake version was changed to 3.8.

    Library:
    --------
    * New C and Fortran APIs that allows for reading/writing datatypes 
      that are different from cgsize_t:
            cg_section_general_write(_f)
            cg_section_initialize(_f)
            cg_parent_data_write(_f)
            cg_elements_general_write(_f)
            cg_poly_elements_general_write(_f)
            cg_elements_general_read(_f)
            cg_poly_elements_general_read(_f)
            cg_parent_elements_general_read(_f)
            cg_parent_elements_position_general_read(_f)
      CGNS-212
    * Added a diskless option for creating a CGNS file in memory 
      (i.e. uses HDF5 "core" file driver), and then to optionally
      persist the memory to disk. Enablable through cg_configure.
      CGNS-239
    * Mapping of X4/X8 was lost when moving from ADF to HDF5.
      This fix reintroduces it as an experimental feature.
      It uses an H5T_COMPOUND and is compatible with the standard C99 complex type.

      Depending on the application, people can still store each part of a complex number 
      in separate arrays by prefixing with Re or Im the name of the array, CGNS-202

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
    * Tuned the parallel library algorithms to improve metadata type operations, PR#238,#236

    Fortran Library:
    ----------------
    * Add Fortran wrapper for cg_configure, CGNS-243

    Tools:
    ------
    * Experimental support for conversion of FamilySpecified BC for AFLR3 file format, PR#247
    * Added check on node names according to SIDS (check that dot and slash are not at 
      the start of the name, see:https://cgns.github.io/CGNS_docs_current/hdf5/general.html) and 
      added warning if ZoneBC_t is missing while zone surfaces are present in a 3D mesh.


Bug Fixes since CGNS 4.1.2 release
==================================

    Library:
    -------
    * Fixed test_convert_elem failing with NAG 7.0 and gcc 10, CGNS-231
    * Fixed cg_configure always reporting a false error 
      when using adfh parameters, CGNS-241
    * Made the parameter CG_MODE_CLOSED private since it only 
      used internally, CGNS-240
    * Fixed an issue with too many MPI communicators being created when
      many CGNS files are open, CGNS-109
    * Fixed issue of cg_open failing after calling cgp_open, CGNS-141
    * Fixed MPI_Recv in test_poly_unstructured, PR#224
    * Fixed MPI_Allgather in test_poly_unstructured #223
    * VS 2019 issues: Fixed shared library builds on windows, 
      Rearranged header files, fixed #if/#ifdef bug, PR#208
    * Misc. compiler issues and added check C99 Complex support 
      at compile time to enable it, PR#202 
    * Fixed cgio_copy_node() failing with INVALID_DATA_TYPE error 
      when HDF5 backend is employed, PR#198

    Fortran:
    --------
    * Fixed test cgread_f03 failing for arch ppc64el, CGNS-179
    * Fixed "Fortran types mismatch between actual argument" errors
      with gfortran 10.x, CGNS-227

    Configuration:
    -------------
    * Fixed configure issues with tcl, tk, CGNS-147
    * Fixed build failures with HDF 1.10.3, CGNS-143
    * Removed zlib and szip header checks when linking directory is provided
      removed header checking for standard locations, CGNS-233
    * Added warning about using gfortran 10.2 as a result of a compiler
      bug, CGNS-246
    

    Tools:
    ------
    * Fixed issue with cgnstools not being able to read hdf5 files, CGNS-203
    * Fixed cgnscheck's strange warning about non-boundary elements, CGNS-234
    * Added cgnscheck a warning for BC that should be of type FamilySpecified, PR#206
    * Added .desktop startup files for GUI cgnstools, PR#200
    * Allow relocation of cgnstools dir, PR#199

Known Problems
==============

    ************ FORTRAN ************
    
    * A gfortran bug in version 10.2 broke Fortran mapping and caused cg_goto_f 
     to segfault. All other versions of gfortran are suitable.
     (ref. CGNS-246, GNU BUG 100149)

    * A bug in gfortran (all versions) causes cg_configure_f to fail,
      GNU BUG 99982. Other Fortran compilers are fine.

    ************ FORTRAN END ********

    ************ CGNSVIEW ************
    
    * cgnsview for OSX is not viewing properly and cgnsview under Windows 
      may fail to compile due to tcl/tk incompatibility. 
    
    ************ CGNSVIEW END ********

New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------

    Library:
    --------

    - Implemented CPEX42 (Storing bounding box of a grid, CGNS-149)
    - Implemented CPEX43 (Family hierarchy as a tree, CGNS-180)
    - Switch to using HDF5 Compact storage for smaller datasets
    
      Added HDF5 compact storage to CGNS to improve parallel IO performance. The default storage 
      is compact storage unless the dataset does not meet the < 64KiB limit. Also, if the 
      dataset can have partial IO, then it is contiguous storage. Also, removed 'tab' spacing. 
      All changes should be transparent to the application code. (CGNS-160, PR-130)

Bug Fixes since CGNS 4.0.0 release
==================================

    Library:
    -------

      ****************** REMOVED APIS **************************

      Removed the APIs:

      cgio_read_all_data, cgio_read_data, cgio_read_block_data
      cgio_read_all_data_f, cgio_read_data_f, cgio_read_block_data_f

      These APIs should be used instead:

      cgio_read_all_data_type, cgio_read_data_type, cgio_read_block_data_type
      cgio_read_all_data_type_f, cgio_read_data_type_f, cgio_read_block_data_type_f

      (CGNS-192)

      ****************** REMOVED APIS **************************

      * Fixed tests for scoped enum use. (PR-123)

      * Unified similar defines. (PR-124)

      * Fixed bad assert. (PR-125)

      * Corrected print format. (CGNS-152, PR-126)

      * (CGNS-158, PR #128)
          Fixed heap buffer overflow in cgi_read_ptset
          In cgi_read_ptset there is made a difference between point set of list and range type.
          The 'CellListDonor' type was missing in the list of list types and this led to a heap buffer overflow.
          Added 'CellListDonor' type to list of list types.

      * (CGNS-159, PR #127)
          Fixed global-buffer-overflow in ADFI_string_2_C_string.
    
          Added a search loop for an early NULL termination of the string passed to ADFI_string_2_C_string in 
          order to prevent global-buffer-overflow when string literals are given as a parameter.
      
      * Fixed return stat after calling MPI_Finalize and  switched to using a MPI_AllReduce to get the same 
        exit code on all the processes.

      * Fixed typo, zc should be z3

      * Fixed Problems linking Fortran code with 3.3.1 shared library (w/ CMake) (CGNS-118, PR-131)

      * Do not read elements when computing partial data size. (PR-137)

      * Disabled the use of H5Pset_file_space_strategy as it is not compatible with HDF5 v1.8 (CGNS-166)

      * Use correct MPI communicator (PR-140)
    
        The `MPI_Allreduce` call in `cgp_parent_data_write()` is using `MPI_COMM_WORLD`, but would be more correct 
        to use the communicator stored in `cgp_mpi_comm` which is set by the client. If the client is not using 
        `MPI_COMM_WORLD` and calls this function, it will hang since not all ranks will be participating in the call.
    
        Expanded open-close test to include mixed serial and parallel open and close
    
      * Fixed incorrect variable type (PR-143)
    
        Minor fix; only applicable if more than 2.1 billion intervals in a range, but does eliminate a 
        compiler warning -- `npt` should be `cgsize_t`

      * Fixed compiler warnings about the possible loss of data (PR-144)
    
        A few variables defined as `int` should be `ssize_t` to avoid potential loss of data on large models.

        
      * Corrupted memory when reading int32 connectivity into an int64 dataspace, (CGNS-157)
    
        Fixed by changing the cgio_read* calls internal to the MLL to use the
        cgio_read*_type APIs instead. Created a new cgio_read_block_data_type API with 
        an added data type parameter.

      * Removed non-standard unlink call

      * Make static mpi-related variables consistent (PR-139)

        Currently, it is possible for the `pcg_mpi_comm` to be inconsistent with 
        `pcg_mpi_comm_rank` and `pcg_mpi_comm_size`. The latter two values are set during a 
        call to `cgp_open,` and the first is set during a call to `cgp_mpi_comm.`  If the user 
        is using both parallel and serial file access during the same run, they may call 
        `cgp_mpi_comm` multiple times, and the values of `pcg_mpi_comm_rank` and `pcg_mpi_comm_size` 
        will only be consistent with the communicator in `pcg_mpi_comm` if the user calls `cgp_open.`
    
        With this fix, all three values (and the `ParallelMPICommunicator`) will always be consistent.  
        Also, if the user does not call `cgp_mpi_comm()` before calling `cgp_open(),` 
        this will be detected, and everything will be consistent.

        Initialize communicator to MPI_COMM_NULL

      * miscellaneous code quality improvements and warning fixes.

    Fortran:
    --------
      * Added missing BUILD_PARALLEL_F. (ref. PR-124)

      * Fixed cgiof_f03.F90 test passing literal character instead of NULL character in CGIO_CREATE_LINK_F

    Configuration:
    -------------
      * Fixed HDF5 CMake feature detection for parallel Collective_metadata and
        H5Pset_file_space_strategy. (PR-138)

      * Fixed HDF5 feature detection (PR-138)
        

    Tools:
    ------

       * Fix cgnstools install (PR-129)

## ISSUE [1]

     In the cgnslib code, forward compatibility is always ensured by cg_open function, which prevents major version incompatibilities and returns gracefully. This well-designed code provision does not hold for cgnslib v3.4.0, which has the same major version number, but significantly different NGON data structures. Thus, the library cannot protect the API users anymore, and unexpected software behaviors might occur.
     
     So, if one upgrades to the new cgnslib 3.4.0, they will create CGNS files that will crash when read by other parties who are still using the previous v3.x libraries. This will lead to problems in the community whose aim is to maintain a general, portable and extensible standard that makes it easier to share files between sites and collaborators.

### RESOLUTION
     
     Patch 3.4.0 by removing CPEX 41 NGON modification.

     Reintroduce CPEX 41 in the 4.0.0 release.

### ACTION
    
Removed CPEX 41 NGON modification proposal (CGNS-121); these commits were removed:

* Revert "support new ngon layout"
         This reverts commit 83fc242833d66dd6bb3b6b0f03dc5d71ae59c162.

* Revert "fix uninitialized memory for offset."
         This reverts commit 3fdc9d89ac1b452fc95abd6849f1b07535b500ba.
  
* Revert "fix cgnscheck due to new memory layout with ngon_n and nface_n"
         This reverts commit 2c09bad0efc4b0042d1b69c3c59309a6f2ea74b9.

CONTENTS
============

- New Features
- Support for new platforms and languages
- Bug Fixes since CGNS 3.2.1
- Known Problems

New Features
==============

    Configuration:
    ------------------
    * Example build scripts for supercomputer systems can be found in src/SampleScripts 
      of the CGNS source code. They include scripts for building zlib, 
      hdf5 (assuming the user does not already have them installed system wide) 
      and a script for building CGNS. All the scripts use autotools; cmake remains untested.

    * The Fortran compiler environment variable can now be set with "FC", this is the preferred
      method.

    * The Fortran compiler flags can now be set with "FCFLAGS", this is the preferred method.
      If both FFLAGS (which predates FCFLAGS) and FCFLAGS are set then FCFLAGS is ignored. (CGNS-23)

    Library:
    ------------
    * Replaced the hid_t to double (and vice-versa) utilities to_HDF_ID and to_ADF_ID 
      from a type cast to a function which uses memcpy for the conversion. This is needed 
      for the upcoming release of HDF5 1.10 where hid_t was changed from a 32 bit integer 
      to a 64 bit integer. Should be transparent to user.

    * Implemented CPEX0039 : To enable with CGNS_ENABLE_BASE_SCOPE

    * Implemented CPEX0038 : Quadratic Elements for High Order


    Parallel Library:
    ---------------------
    * The default parallel input/output mode was changed from CGP_INDEPENDENT 
      to CGP_COLLECTIVE.

    * A new function was added for passing MPI info to the CGNS library:
      cgp_mpi_info (cgp_mpi_info_f)

    * A new parallel example benchmark program, benchmark_hdf5.c, was added 
      to directory ptests.

    * The cgp_*_read/write_dataset APIs now excepts non-allocated arrays, or NULL, 
      as valid parameters for the datasets. Additionally, the dimensional arrays, 
      rmin and rmax, can also be NULL. If the data array is NULL and the dimensional 
      arrays are not NULL, then the validity of the dimensional arrays, rmin and rmax, 
      is not checked. For collective parallel IO, this is used as a mechanism to 
      indicated that processes with NULL API parameters will not write any data to the file.

    * cgp_queue_set and cgp_queue_flush were depreciated in this release.

    Fortran Library:
    --------------------
    * SUPPORT WAS DROPPED FOR NON-FORTRAN 2003 COMPLIANT COMPILERS.

    * Configure was changed to check if the Fortran compiler is Fortran 2003 compliant.

    * The predefined CGNS constant parameters data types were changed from 
      INTEGER to ENUM, BIND(C) for better C interoperability. The users should use the 
      predefined constants whenever possible and not the numerical value represented by 
      the constants. A variable expecting an enum value returned from a Fortran API should be 
      declared, INTEGER(cgenum_t).

    * INCLUDE "cgslib_h" was changed in favor of using a module, USE CGNS.
      - This allows defining a KIND type for integers instead of 
        the current way of using the preprocessor dependent cgsize_t.

    * The user should be sure to declare the arguments 
      declared int in the C APIs as INTEGER in Fortran. The ONLY 
      Fortran arguments declared as type cgsize_t should be the 
      arguments which are also declared cgsize_t in the C APIs. This 
      is very important when building with option --enable-64bit. The 
      test programs were updated in order to conform to this convention.

    * Assuming the rules in step [enu:int64] were followed, users 
      should not need to use parameter CG_BUILD_64BIT since Fortran's 
      cgsize_t is now guaranteed to match C's cgsize_t. 

    * Fortran programs defining CGNS data types with a default 
      INTEGER size of 8 bytes also then need to compile the CGNS 
      library with the default INTEGER size of 8 bytes. This is 
      independent of whether or not --enable-64bit is being used. For 
      clarification, using --enable-64bit allows for data types (i.e. 
      those declared as cgsize_t) to be able to store values which 
      are too large to be stored as 4 byte integers (i.e. numbers 
      greater than 2,147,483,647). It is not necessary, or advisable 
      (since it waste memory), to have CGNS INTEGER types (types 
      declared int in C) to be 8 bytes; the variables declared as 
      cgsize_t will automatically handle data types that can not be 
      stored as 4 byte integers when --enable-64bit is being used. If 
      the CGNS library was not compiled with a default INTEGER of 8 
      bytes, but the calling program was, then all integers passed to 
      CGNS with C type int should be declared INTEGER(C_INT).   

    * A new Fortran API was added for determining the CGNS data type of a 
      variable which is interoperable with the C data type. 

      Function cg_get_type(var)
         type, INTENT(IN) :: var
         INTEGER(KIND(enumvar)) :: cg_get_type

      An example of using the new function to automatically specify the CGNS 
      type corresponding to the Fortran data type is,

         INTEGER, DIMENSION(1:10) :: Array_i
         CALL cgp_array_write_f("ArrayI",cg_get_type(Array_i(1)),1,INT(nijk(1),cgsize_t),Ai, err)

    * Removed all parallel flush/queue functions (CGNS-9)

    * Removed support of "include cgns_f.h", all examples and tests were updated to reflect these changes (CGNS-34)

    Tools:

     - None

Bug Fixes since CGNS 3.2.1 release
==================================

    Configuration:
    ------------------
    * Fixed issue with autotools putting a blank "-l" in "MPILIBS =" when compiling the library
      using mpi.

    * Added a new PGI fortran compiler flag fix issue when  passing to C varags (CGNS-40)

    * CMake find_package was added for HDF5, users should use -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HDF_DIR to
      specify a specific version of HDF5.


    Library:
    ------------

    * Generally improved the performance of cgp_open (cgp_open_f).

    * Fixed elemtest.c to compile for SunOS 5.12 (CGNS-29)

    * Fixed parallel issue when not all processors involved in reading/writing (CGNS-51)
    
    * Fixed argument being passed to H5Pget_driver in ADFH.c (CGNS-50)

    * Fixed issue with writing/reading 4D and higher arrays in parallel (CGNS-19) 

    Fortran:
    ------------

    * cgio_link_size_f -- file_len and name_len were changed from cgsize_t to integer to match the C API, CGNS-37.

    * cgio_is_link_f -- cgio_num was changed from type cgsize_t to an integer to match the C API, CGNS-36.

    * cgio_is_supported_f -- ier changed from cgsize_t to integer to match the C API, CGNS-35.

    * Added PGI flag to fix cg_goto_f failing with the PGI compilers on x86_64 platforms, CGNS-40.


    Tools:
    ----------
    * None

Known Problems
================

   * Building CGNS with Fortran enabled is not working on Windows.
   * When building with PGI and gcc compilers it might be necassary to set the
     environment variables:
            FLIBS="-Wl,--no-as-needed -ldl"
            LIBS="-Wl,--no-as-needed -ldl"

== 3.2.1 ==
- fixed problem with IS_FIXED_SIZE macro for cubic elements
- added check for open file to routines that don't take
  a file number (suggestion from Marc Poinet)
- added HTMLHelp interface to cmake scripts
- added AdditionalFamilyName to UserDefinedData
- fixed compiler complaint about comparison between int and enum
- added routines to set MPI communicator for parallel I/O
- updated CMake scripts to work within other scripts (remove conflicts)
- updates to some cgnstools utility conversion routines
- fixes and updates to tests and cgnscheck
- updates to support CG_FILE_ADF2 (2.5 compatibility)
- fix for point set subregions

== 3.2 ===
- full integration of parallel I/O using HDF5 with MPI
- implemented CPEX 0033 and 0034
- compression (rewriting) of file to remove unused space is no
  longer automatically done, since may interfere with parallel I/O.
  Added cgnscompress program to tools to do this afterwards.
- removed cgnsversion program from tools since support was getting
  out of hand (N squared problem with versions).
- added routines to convert to and from AFLR3, FAST, and TetGen
- implemented cubic elements (CPEX 0036)
- CGNStools documentation no longer included with source.
  The NASA Glenn website (or local copy) is now used instead.

== 3.1.4-2 ==
- fixes to cmake scripts for Fortran
