New Features
============

    Configuration:
    -------------
    * The default was changed from 32-bit to 64-bit building of CGNS, PR#216
    * The minimum CMake version was changed to 3.8.

    Library:
    --------
    * New C and Fortran APIs that allows for reading/writing datatypes 
      that are different from cgsize_t:
            cg_section_general_write(_f)
            cg_section_initialize(_f)
            cg_parent_data_write(_f)
            cg_elements_general_write(_f)
            cg_poly_elements_general_write(_f)
            cg_elements_general_read(_f)
            cg_poly_elements_general_read(_f)
            cg_parent_elements_general_read(_f)
            cg_parent_elements_position_general_read(_f)
      CGNS-212
    * Added a diskless option for creating a CGNS file in memory 
      (i.e. uses HDF5 "core" file driver), and then to optionally
      persist the memory to disk. Enablable through cg_configure.
      CGNS-239
    * Mapping of X4/X8 was lost when moving from ADF to HDF5.
      This fix reintroduces it as an experimental feature.
      It uses an H5T_COMPOUND and is compatible with the standard C99 complex type.

      Depending on the application, people can still store each part of a complex number 
      in separate arrays by prefixing with Re or Im the name of the array, CGNS-202

    Parallel Library:
    -----------------
    * Tuned the parallel library algorithms to improve metadata type operations, PR#238,#236

    Fortran Library:
    ----------------
    * Add Fortran wrapper for cg_configure, CGNS-243

    Tools:
    ------
    * Experimental support for conversion of FamilySpecified BC for AFLR3 file format, PR#247
    * Added check on node names according to SIDS (check that dot and slash are not at 
      the start of the name, see:https://cgns.github.io/CGNS_docs_current/hdf5/general.html) and 
      added warning if ZoneBC_t is missing while zone surfaces are present in a 3D mesh.


Bug Fixes since CGNS 4.1.2 release
==================================

    Library:
    -------
    * Fixed test_convert_elem failing with NAG 7.0 and gcc 10, CGNS-231
    * Fixed cg_configure always reporting a false error 
      when using adfh parameters, CGNS-241
    * Made the parameter CG_MODE_CLOSED private since it only 
      used internally, CGNS-240
    * Fixed an issue with too many MPI communicators being created when
      many CGNS files are open, CGNS-109
    * Fixed issue of cg_open failing after calling cgp_open, CGNS-141
    * Fixed MPI_Recv in test_poly_unstructured, PR#224
    * Fixed MPI_Allgather in test_poly_unstructured #223
    * VS 2019 issues: Fixed shared library builds on windows, 
      Rearranged header files, fixed #if/#ifdef bug, PR#208
    * Misc. compiler issues and added check C99 Complex support 
      at compile time to enable it, PR#202 
    * Fixed cgio_copy_node() failing with INVALID_DATA_TYPE error 
      when HDF5 backend is employed, PR#198

    Fortran:
    --------
    * Fixed test cgread_f03 failing for arch ppc64el, CGNS-179
    * Fixed "Fortran types mismatch between actual argument" errors
      with gfortran 10.x, CGNS-227

    Configuration:
    -------------
    * Fixed configure issues with tcl, tk, CGNS-147
    * Fixed build failures with HDF 1.10.3, CGNS-143
    * Removed zlib and szip header checks when linking directory is provided
      removed header checking for standard locations, CGNS-233
    * Added warning about using gfortran 10.2 as a result of a compiler
      bug, CGNS-246
    

    Tools:
    ------
    * Fixed issue with cgnstools not being able to read hdf5 files, CGNS-203
    * Fixed cgnscheck's strange warning about non-boundary elements, CGNS-234
    * Added cgnscheck a warning for BC that should be of type FamilySpecified, PR#206
    * Added .desktop startup files for GUI cgnstools, PR#200
    * Allow relocation of cgnstools dir, PR#199

Known Problems
==============

    ************ FORTRAN ************
    
    * A gfortran bug in version 10.2 broke Fortran mapping and caused cg_goto_f 
     to segfault. All other versions of gfortran are suitable.
     (ref. CGNS-246, GNU BUG 100149)

    * A bug in gfortran (all versions) causes cg_configure_f to fail,
      GNU BUG 99982. Other Fortran compilers are fine.

    ************ FORTRAN END ********

    ************ CGNSVIEW ************
    
    * cgnsview for OSX is not viewing properly and cgnsview under Windows 
      may fail to compile due to tcl/tk incompatibility. 
    
    ************ CGNSVIEW END ********
