## About

The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) provides a standard for recording and recovering computer data associated with the numerical solution of fluid dynamics equations.

## Installation

### Installation Instructions using `cmake`

1. Install HDF5 on your system.
  
   - HDF5 can use the standard GNU autotools, so `./configure`, `make`, `sudo make install` should install HDF5 without problems on most systems.
2. Unpack the tar ball containing the source code into some directory.
3. Create a new directory in which to build the library.
4. Use `cmake` to initialize the build tree.
   ```shell
   user@hostname:build_path$ cmake /path/to/cgns/sources/
   ```
5. Use `ccmake` to edit the control variables as needed.
   ```shell
   user@hostname:build_path$ ccmake .
   ```
   - The path to the HDF5 library should be specified with `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HDF_DIR` for linking with a specific HDF5 version.
     - If HDF5 is built with parallel-IO support via MPI, the `HDF5_NEEDS_MPI` flag must be set to `true`.
     - If HDF5 is built with `zlib` and `szip` support, these need to be flagged with `HDF5_NEEDS_ZLIB` and `HDF5_NEEDS_SZIP` as well as the paths for those libraries.
   - Fortran can be enabled by toggling the `CGNS_ENABLE_FORTRAN` variable.
     - A view of the attempt to autodetect the correct interface between Fortran and C is show, setting the value of `FORTRAN_NAMING`.
     - For `gfortran` and `pgf90` the value of `FORTRAN_NAMING` should be `LOWERCASE_`.
   - The build system must be reconfigured after variable changes by pressing `c`. Variables who's value has changed are marked with a `*` in the interface.
   - After configuration, the `Makefile`s must be generated by pressing `g`.
6. Use `make` to build the library.
   ```shell
   user@hostname:build_path$ make
   ```
   - A colorized review of the build process should follow.
7. Installation of the library is accomplished with the `install` target of the makefile.
   ```shell
   user@hostname:build_path$ make install
   ```
   - You must have permissions to alter the directory where CGNS will be installed.

### Installation Instructions using `make`

1. Install HDF5 on your system.
   - HDF5 can use the standard GNU autotools, so `./configure`, `make`, `sudo make install` should install HDF5 without problems on most systems.
2. Typically the standard `./configure`, `make`, `make install` will suffice.  
3. Sample scripts for building parallel CGNS can be found in `src/SampleScripts`.
